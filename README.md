# NO-YELLING

This userscript modifies all plain text nodes of Canvas/Instructure course pages to be in sentence case. Created because some professors like to YELL with ALL CAPS in everything they type and that is super annoying. It does not understand proper nouns or acronyms it just blindly sets all text to sentence case.

Userscript created from [@violentmonkey/generator-userscript](https://github.com/violentmonkey/generator-userscript).
